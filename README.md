# MediaQueriesDemo
To experience how media queries work at different  screen (i used different color to represent it) using html and css 

    I actually used four steps do it 
      1) for large screen device 
      2) laptop and large screen tabs(screen  1440px -1024px)
      3) tablets (1024px to 768px)
      4) mobile and mini-tablets (445px and less than 768px)
